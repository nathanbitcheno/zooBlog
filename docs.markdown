# zooBlog Documentation

zooBlog is a static site content management system (CMS). A folder of files are used as the source for a program called Hippo, which outputs another folder of files (Output). To enable a wide range of workflows we support the following:

Source Syncing: Sync files from your chosen source for Hippo to build from and have changes synced back
Publishing: Enable git workflows for editors
Output Syncing: Sync the output from Hippo to be used by another system
